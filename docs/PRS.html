Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it

Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to
make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for

The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  code/run_workflowr.R
    Untracked:  output/BLCA_FGFR3_Aneuploidy.Score_reg59e6f336fd3d8

Unstaged changes:
    Deleted:    analysis/example.Rmd
    Modified:   diffdriver.Rproj

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
